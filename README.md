# Twitter-Bots
A repo for python twitter bots - let's automate things

## Getting Started
First you will need to create a twitter developer account to be able to access 
the Twitter API: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access

export CONSUMER_KEY="your_consumer_key"
export CONSUMER_SECRET="your_consumer_secret"

```
python3 followBot.py
```
